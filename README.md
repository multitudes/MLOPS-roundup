## Langflow
Langflow is a low-code, open-source platform designed for developers to build and deploy AI-powered applications,  
multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.  
built with Python. This means developers can access the underlying code,  
customize components, and extend the platform's functionality to fit their specific needs.  
It specializes in building agentic AI, where AI agents can use various tools and APIs to perform tasks. Langflow also facilitates the creation of RAG applications, which enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and retrieve information from external knowledge bases.
